**GraphMiner** is a powerful Bash script designed to extract GraphQL queries and mutations from JavaScript (JS) files associated with a specified domain. Leveraging the capabilities of [`waymore`](https://github.com/Xnl-h4ck3r/waymore) and [`httpx`](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx), GraphMiner automates the process of discovering JS URLs, retrieving their responses, and parsing them for valuable GraphQL operations.

## üöÄ Features

- **Automated JS URL Retrieval**: Uses `waymore` to gather all JavaScript URLs related to the target domain.
- **GraphQL Extraction**: Utilizes `httpx` to probe JS responses and extract GraphQL queries and mutations.
- **Organized Output**: Stores results in structured directories for easy access and analysis.
- **Dependency Checks**: Verifies the presence of required tools before execution, providing clear installation instructions if any are missing.
- **User-Friendly**: Provides clear prompts and summaries to guide users through the extraction process.

---

## üõ† Prerequisites

Before using **GraphMiner**, ensure that the following tools are installed and accessible in your system's `PATH`:

1. **Bash**: Most Unix-like systems come with Bash pre-installed.
2. **waymore**: Tool to retrieve URLs and responses from the Wayback Machine.
3. **httpx**: Fast and multi-purpose HTTP toolkit.
4. **grep**: Text search utility.
5. **sed**: Stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
6. **bc**: Basic calculator for floating-point arithmetic.

### Installing Dependencies

- **Debian/Ubuntu:**

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install bc grep sed
  ```

- **macOS (using Homebrew):**

  ```bash
  brew install bc grep gnu-sed
  ```

  *Note: On macOS, GNU `sed` might be installed as `gsed`. You may need to adjust the script accordingly.*

- **Install `waymore`:**

  Follow the installation instructions from the [waymore GitHub repository](https://github.com/Xnl-h4ck3r/waymore).

- **Install `httpx`:**

  Follow the installation instructions from the [httpx GitHub repository](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx).

## üõ† Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tavgar/GraphMiner.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd GraphMiner
   ```

3. **Make the Script Executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x graphminer.sh
   ```

---

## üìñ Usage

Execute the **GraphMiner** script using the terminal:

```bash
./graphminer.sh
```

### Script Workflow

1. **Tool Verification**: The script first checks if all required tools (`waymore`, `httpx`, `grep`, `sed`, `bc`) are installed. If any are missing, it provides installation instructions and exits.

2. **User Prompt**: Prompts the user to enter the target domain.

3. **JS URL Retrieval**: Uses `waymore` to fetch all JS URLs and their responses associated with the domain.

4. **GraphQL Extraction**: Employs `httpx` to probe the retrieved JS URLs, extracting GraphQL mutations and queries.

5. **Result Organization**: Saves the extracted data into structured directories for easy access.

6. **Summary Display**: Provides a summary of the extraction process, including the number of JS URLs processed and the counts of extracted mutations and queries.

---

## üóÇ Output

Upon successful execution, **GraphMiner** creates the following directories in the current working directory:

- **`graphminer_waymore_results`**
  - `urls.txt`: Contains all extracted URLs from `waymore`.
  - `js_urls.txt`: Contains filtered JS URLs.

- **`graphminer_js_responses`**
  - Stores the downloaded JS response files from `waymore`.

- **`graphminer_httpx_results`**
  - `extracted_matches.txt`: Raw extracted mutations and queries.
  - `mutations.txt`: List of extracted GraphQL mutations.
  - `queries.txt`: List of extracted GraphQL queries.

## üí° Example

```bash
$ ./graphminer.sh
Checking for required tools...
All required tools are installed.
Enter the domain: example.com
[*] Running waymore to retrieve JS URLs and responses...
[+] waymore completed.
[*] Extracting JS URLs...
[+] Found 15 JS URLs.
[*] Running httpx to extract mutations and queries...
[+] httpx extraction completed.
[*] Processing extracted matches...
[+] Mutations and queries extracted.
----------------------------------------
Summary:
Total JS URLs processed: 15
Total Mutations Extracted: 5
Total Queries Extracted: 8
----------------------------------------
[*] Extraction completed successfully.
Results are saved in the following directories:
 - JS Responses: ./graphminer_js_responses
 - Waymore URLs: ./graphminer_waymore_results
 - Httpx Results: ./graphminer_httpx_results
```
